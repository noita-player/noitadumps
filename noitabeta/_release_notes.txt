MODDING: Added a new tag 'projectile_player' for all default player projectiles
MODDING: Lua - added dofile_once(filename). Use this if possible. Like dofile(), but runs the script only once per lua context.
MODDING: Lua - dofile() and loadfile() return values follow lua conventions (breaking change)
MODDING: Lua - dofile() caches the compiled code, so successive calls using the same file are (a lot) faster
